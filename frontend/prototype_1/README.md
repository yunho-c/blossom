## Overview

This is a sample Lens Studio project that demonstrates how to implement simple but realistic throwing mechanic in Lens Studio based on physics. It showcases a clean, componentized architecture that takes advantage of the new **Hand Velocity API**.
By exploring the ThrowLab project, you’ll gain a practical understanding of implementing realistic throwing mechanics in AR. This foundation will help you build more engaging and interactive Lens Studio lenses.

> **NOTE:**
> This project will only work for the Spectacles platform.

## Design Guidelines

Designing Lenses for Spectacles offers all-new possibilities to rethink user interaction with digital spaces and the physical world.
Get started using our [Design Guidelines](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/best-practices/design-for-spectacles/introduction-to-spatial-design)

## Prerequisites

- **Lens Studio**: v5.7.2+
- **Spectacles OS Version**: v5.60+
- **Spectacles App iOS**: v0.60.1.1+
- **Spectacles App Android**: v0.60.1.1+

To update your Spectacles device and mobile app, refer to this [guide](https://support.spectacles.com/hc/en-us/articles/30214953982740-Updating).

You can download the latest version of Lens Studio from [here](https://ar.snap.com/download?lang=en-US).

## Hand Velocity API

This API gives an easy and reliable way of getting the velocity of hand joints as `vec3`s in world coordinate system.

The API can be used together with SIK:

````
   let handInputData = SIK.HandInputData;
   let hand = this.handInputData.getHand('right');
   let objectSpecificData = this.hand.objectTracking3D.objectSpecificData
   if (objectSpecificData) {
      let handVelocity = objectSpecificData['global'];
      let indexVelocity = objectSpecificData['index-3'];
   }
````

The following joints are available for the velocities: “index-3”, “mid-3”, “ring-3”, “pinky-3”, “thumb-3” and “global”.

## Project Overview

With ThrowLab, you can pinch to grab, and then throw four different objects. We have 2 example objects in the project:

- [**Ball**](./Assets/Scripts/TennisBallBehavior.ts)
- [**Dart**](./Assets/Scripts/DartBehavior.ts)

Each object has slightly different behaviors and corresponding sounds on collision. Dart is a more complex example with some specific logic for hitting the dart board. 

## How It Works

1. **Hand Detection & Velocity Calculation**:  
   Lens Studio’s Hand Tracking system detects your hand. As you move, the Hand Velocity API provides the velocity of the relevant joints.

2. **Object Selection & Holding**  
   ThrowLab uses a pinch gesture provided by the Spectacles Interaction Kit (SIK) to allow the user to pinch the objects. When you pinch near an object, it attaches to your hand, simulating a pinched hold.

3. **Throwing Mechanics**:  
   While pinching and moving the object, the system continuously tracks acceleration, accumulating data over the time you hold it. When you release the pinch, the final throw velocity is a combination of:
   - The object’s accumulated acceleration during the hold.
   - The hand’s velocity at the moment of release.

   By blending these factors, you get a smoother, more realistic throwing motion that accounts for the object’s buildup of speed as you swing your hand.

4. **Cleanup**:  
   After the object finishes its flight (for example, when it hits the ground and stay still), it destroys itself after some time buffer to keep the scene clean.


## Using it in your Project

The Tennis Ball object is available as an [.lspkg file](./TennisBall_Importable.lspkg). You can easily drag and drop it into your project to easily get started. Or just start with the [**TennisBallBehavior.ts**](./Assets/Scripts/TennisBallBehavior.ts) script.
